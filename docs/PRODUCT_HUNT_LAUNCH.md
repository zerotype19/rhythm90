### Maker Story
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], and I built Rhythm90.io to solve a problem I've seen in every marketing team I've worked with: the challenge of systematically tracking and acting on marketing signals.

**The Problem:**
Marketing teams are drowning in data but starving for insights. We collect signals from everywhere - social media, email campaigns, website analytics - but we struggle to connect the dots and take action.

**The Solution:**
Rhythm90.io provides a structured approach to marketing signal management. Instead of scattered observations, teams can create "plays" with clear outcomes, track signals systematically, and get AI-powered recommendations on what to do next.

**What Makes It Different:**
• **Structured Approach**: Unlike generic analytics tools, Rhythm90 focuses specifically on marketing signal management
• **AI-Powered Insights**: Our AI assistant helps teams understand what signals mean and what actions to take
• **Team Collaboration**: Built for teams to work together, not just individual analysts
• **Actionable Outputs**: Generate R&R summaries automatically for stakeholders

**The Journey:**
This started as a side project to help my own marketing team, but after seeing the impact it had, I decided to build it into a full product. We've been in beta with a few teams and the feedback has been incredible.

**What's Next:**
We're launching our public beta today! I'd love to hear your feedback and see how Rhythm90 can help your marketing team run smarter quarters.

Thanks for checking us out! 🚀
